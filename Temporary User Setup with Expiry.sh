# As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named rose requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:

# Create a user named rose on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-02-17, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.


ssh steve@172.16.238.11

sudo useradd rose -e 2024-02-17
